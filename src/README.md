Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

# Main

In the main method of my gui.c file I will be declaring all the variables such
as int, char *, char**, and some additional arrays which were used for testing
at the time this was made. In the main method I called...

-word_start
-word_end
-copy_str
-tokenize
-free_tokens

then from the histoy.c file I would call on these methods...

-init_history
-add_history
-get_history
-free_history
